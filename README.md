Education
---------

* **Makers Academy**<br>
Studying at Makers Academy was an incredible experience which taught me both about programming and about myself and how I work.  During the course we covered fundamentals of good code practice, such as test-driven development, and there was an emphasis on pair-programming to encourage team work skills and overall efficiency.  These skills were put to the test in the last two weeks, when we worked on our final projects in groups of six.  My project was an emergency healthcare web app built on a Ruby on Rails framework, which can be found at www.medicode.org.uk, for which my main focus was the front end, mainly of the homepage, the logo design and the jQuery library implementation for the drop-down medications field.  Some of the languages we covered during the course were ruby, object-oriented javascript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS (and SCSS), and coffeescript.
